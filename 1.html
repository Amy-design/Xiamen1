  <h2>Xiamen에 대해서</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen" target="_blank" title="Xiamen wikipedia">Xiamen</a> alternately known as <u><strong>Amoy</strong></u> is a sub-provincial city in southeastern Fujian, People's Republic of China, beside  the Taiwan Strait.
  </p>  <img src="xiamen1.jpg" width="600"><p style="margin-top:20px;">It is divided into six districts: Huli, Siming, Jimei, Tong'an, Haicang, and Xiang'an, and I live in Jimei. The city is well known for its mild climate, Hokkien culture and Gulangyu Island, as well as its relatively low pollution. In 2006, Xiamen was ranked as China's second-"most suitable city for living", as well as China's "most romantic leisure city" in 2011.</p>
